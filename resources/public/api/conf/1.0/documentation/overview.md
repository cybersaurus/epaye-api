This API retrieves data about PAYE for employers. It provides the following information:
* ePAYE balance including any interest owed
* Monthly totals of Real Time Information (RTI) charges
* Non-RTI charges
* Breakdown of individual charges

This information is intended for use by employers and their agents to check their own calculations of their clients' tax liability.

This version of the API is currently in development and is very likely to be enhanced.
