This API allows Employer's Pay As You Earn (ePAYE) organisations to retrieve information about outstanding bills and payments made from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). 

This version of the API is currently in development and is very likely to change. 

The current API allows the ePAYE organisation to:

  * retrieve totals of outstanding bills
  * retrieve monthly breakdowns of bills
  * retrieve breakdowns by charge type
  * retrieve employee level data
